# üß† Chess Engine Bot

A basic but growing chess engine written in Python, using `python-chess`, `minimax`, and a handcrafted evaluation function. It supports classic play against a human, includes opening book support, and is gradually evolving into a real menace üòà.

## ‚ôü Features

- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning  
- Quiescence search for deeper tactical stability  
- Static evaluation: material + mobility + castling rights  
- Move ordering: prioritizes captures first  
- Supports pawn promotions  
- Reads ECO openings from `eco.json`  
- Pure console interface (no GUI)

---

## üí† Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- [python-chess](https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/)

Install with:

```
pip install python-chess
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play

Just run:

```
python bot.py
```

You play as White. Type your moves in UCI format, like:

```
e2e4
e7e8q  ‚Üê for promotions
```

The bot plays back as Black. The game continues until checkmate or draw. At the end, it shows the result and final evaluation.
